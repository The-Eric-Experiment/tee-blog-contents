# Ongoing Projects {#ongoing-projects}

Here are a few of the projects that I work on and are available for use by anyone who's interested:

## Old'aVista

</a>

Old'aVista is a search engine modeled after AltaVista from circa 1998 that allows searching for websites that used to be hosted on services like Geocities, AOL Hometown, Xoom, Angelfire, Tripod and so on. The motivation to build it is that it's really difficult to search for those websites via the Internet Archive and there are no other options to do that.

Old'aVista is fully compatible with old browsers such as Netscape 3 and Internet Explorer 3 so you can enjoy it in your retro computer.

## Old'aVista Chat!

</a>

Despite being part of Old'aVista, it's actually a completely separate project whose goal is to recreate the experience of HTML chats from the 90's.

This is also fully compatible with old browsers like Netscape 3 and Internet Explorer 3 albeit with some limitations in some cases.

This project is Open Source, so you can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Eric-Experiment/retro-chat-rooms/) and you are encouraged to use it in your own website if you want to.

## Netscape Proxy

[Browservice](https://github.com/ttalvitie/browservice) is an amazing project that allows browsing modern websites on historical browsers such as Internet Explorer 4. The problem is that it doesn't work with Netscape 4, which is my favorite browser.

So I created this project to allow similar functionality to be used specifically on Netscape 4, it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Eric-Experiment/netscape-proxy) for anyone to enjoy.

## More to come!

I will add more projects as they become available, they will have introduction YouTube videos and they will be added here when they are ready.
