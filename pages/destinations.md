Places on the internet worth visiting. This is a list of my favorite websites.

## Today's Web 1.0 {#todaysweb10}

Modern websites that work with OLD browsers such as Netscape, NCSA Mosaic, Internet Explorer and so on as well as services that make old applications usable again.

Some websites here will repeated because they fit in multiple categories.

- <a href="http://theoldnet.com" target="_blank" border="0"><img src="/contents/pages/destinations/theoldnetanimblur2.gif" alt="The Old Net"/></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://theoldnet.com" target="_blank" border="0">The Old Net</a> - This is a project that aims to bring the internet of yesterday back. It uses the wayback machine apis to deliver the old websites while removing any code that would be incompatible with old browsers. With it you can browse the old internet on your retro computer. They also have a proxy server available that makes the experience way more immersive.

- <a href="//www.oldavista.com" target="_blank" border="0"><img src="http://www.oldavista.com/public/button.gif" alt="The Old Net"/></a>&nbsp;<a href="//oldavista.com" target="_blank" border="0">Old'aVista</a> - Okay, I know this is a bit of self-promotion, but this is a great site, if I say so myself. I built Old'aVista to be a search engine where you can find old personal websites from services like Geocities, Angelfire, AOL Hometown, Xoom and other services that are available in the Internet Archive.

- [FrogFind!](http://frogfind.com/) - Do you want to search the modern web and view its content on Vintage Computers? Well, you are in luck! The Youtuber [Action Retro](https://www.youtube.com/ActionRetro) built this website that can be used to do just that!!

- [68k.news](http://68k.news) - Do you find yourself browsing websites like the bbc.co.uk via TheOldNet and thinking. Maaan... This is all old news, I wish I could see what's going on now on my very low memory Vintage Computer! Well, you are in luck again! Also built by [Action Retro](https://www.youtube.com/ActionRetro), 68k.news is a website that shows the Google News in basic HTML. Now you can get pissed off with the state of the world on your Vintate Computer as well!!

## Preservation {#preservation}

Places dedicated to keeping the internet of old alive. With these we can still access websites and software from the old internet today. You probably already know about these but they should be linked anyway.

- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) - From their website, the "Internet Archive is a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites and more."

  It's incredible how much they have been able to archive over the years, my favorite part is definitely the Wayback Machine, in which you can visit old websites.

  ![Wayback Machine](/contents/pages/destinations/waybackmachine-logo.png)

- <a href="http://theoldnet.com" target="_blank" border="0"><img src="/contents/pages/destinations/theoldnetanimblur2.gif" alt="The Old Net"/></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://theoldnet.com" target="_blank" border="0">The Old Net</a> - This is a project that aims to bring the internet of yesterday back. It uses the wayback machine apis to deliver the old websites while removing any code that would be incompatible with old browsers. With it you can browse the old internet on your retro computer. They also have a proxy server available that makes the experience way more immersive.

- <a href="//www.oldavista.com" target="_blank" border="0"><img src="http://www.oldavista.com/public/button.gif" alt="The Old Net"/></a>&nbsp;<a href="//oldavista.com" target="_blank" border="0">Old'aVista</a> - Okay, I know this is a bit of self-promotion, but this is a great site, if I say so myself. I built Old'aVista to be a search engine where you can find old personal websites from services like Geocities, Angelfire, AOL Hometown, Xoom and other services that are available in the Internet Archive.

- [GifCities](https://gifcities.org/) - This is not like Giphy, instead, this uses the internet archive to find Gifs from geocities websites, so these are proper gifs from 90's websites.

- [Escargot](https://escargot.chat/) - Do you miss MSN Messenger? I know I do and well... It's still alive and kicking through this service called Escargot. They managed to reverse engineer the MSN servers and you can use MSN Messenger just like you would in the early 2000's!!

- [OoCities.org](https://www.oocities.org/) - In 2009, Yahoo decided to discontinue Geocities, and with it kill a HUGE part of internet history. Could they have kept it up? Yes! Would it have cost them a lot of money to do it? NO! But they did it anyway. Luckily people managed to scrape and save a lot of the contents from Geocities and that content was made available in a few websites, one of them being OoCities. You can actually download the whole archive via torrent, it's about 600gb (which is nothing for Yahoo...)

## Still alive {#stillalive}

Websites from yesterday that are still online! Some of them may have not been updated in thousands of years, but they can still be useful.

- [Calmira.de](http://calmira.de) - Calmira is a replacement shell for Windows 3.x that makes it look and act like Windows 95. This website is also featured in the Windows 3.x resource page links, I'm putting it here because it's been around forever and it's still up.

- [Gaby's Homepage for CP/M and Computer History](http://gaby.de/ehome.htm) - This is a website that I used to go to all the time in the early 2000's with a lot of cool computing resources.

- [win31.de](http://www.win31.de/eindex.htm) - This website was also made by Gaby Chaundry, the author of the website above and it's all about Windows 3.1x. Of the two websites this is the one I visited the most.

## Web 1.5?!? {#web15}

Imagine how much crazier websites would be if we could use modern technologies in the 90's?

Well you don't have to because the following websites are built with the Web 1.0 spirit, but using modern technologies to take them to a whole new level.

Some of them are current personal websites, and some of them are just paying an homage to the internet of the past.

- [Make Frontend Shit again](https://makefrontendshitagain.party/) - In the spirit of bringing personality back to the internet, Make frontend shit again!

- [Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net/) - I found this website in the old net webring, if you want to have an overdose of gifs and 90's design language, this website is for you. It's insane but I find it extremely nostalgic at the same time.

- [flower.codes](https://flower.codes) - A simple website by a guy called Zach, it has some interesting reading but most of all it shows one side of the web 1.0 spirit that can be a bit forgotten. Sites that just go straight to the point. No flashy animations and images, just plain text and content. Sometimes that's all you need.

- <a href="https://turtlewitch.neocities.org"><img src="https://turtlewitch.neocities.org/buttons/turtlewitch1.gif"></a> - The 90's spirit with a beautiful web design heavily inspired by 80's synthwave aesthetics. This is a very cool looking website with some interesting content.

- <a href="https://cadence.moe" target="_blank"><img src="https://cadence.moe/static/img/cadence_now.png" alt="The text &quot;cadence now!&quot; on a purple background. There is a moon-shaped logo on the left side and a tiny star in the bottom right." width="88" height="31"></a> - Another site like the example above, but a bit simpler. Also with a really nice design and some really interesting content.

- [SADGRL.ONLINE](https://sadgrl.online/) - The author of this website seems like a huge advocate for the spirit of the Web 1.0 today. They really have put a lot of work to give a lot of interesting resources to people who want to build a cool website.

## Computing Resources {#computingresources}

- [Winworld](https://winworldpc.com/home) - This is a website that has been around since 2002 or 2003. This is THE website to find old versions of software in general, especially Microsoft operating sytems. It kinda sucks that they updated the website to use bootstrap or whatever, the old design used to be great.

- [OLDVERSION.com](http://www.oldversion.com/) - Did you know that Winamp is realeasing the classic Winamp skin as an NFT? Now why would you buy that when you can go to the oldversion.com website and download Winamp 2.x and many other old versions of softwares? With Winamp 2.x, you not only get the classic skin but you also get a great MP3 player that works great on old computers and that cool "Winamp! It really whips the llama's ass" when you start it up.

- [Calmira.de](http://calmira.de) - Calmira is a replacement shell for Windows 3.x that makes it look and act like Windows 95. This website is also featured in the Windows 3.x resource page links, I'm putting it here because it's been around forever and it's still up.

- [Gaby's Homepage for CP/M and Computer History](http://gaby.de/ehome.htm) - This is a website that I used to go to all the time in the early 2000's with a lot of cool computing resources.

- [win31.de](http://www.win31.de/eindex.htm) - This website was also made by Gaby Chaundry, the author of the website above and it's all about Windows 3.1x. Of the two websites this is the one I visited the most.

- [VOGONS](https://www.vogons.org/) - This needs no introduction, it's the biggest forum about retro computing on the internet.

## Retro-gaming

- [DCEvolution](http://dcevolution.sourceforge.net/index.php) - A lot of cool pieces of softare for the Sega Dreamcast.

## Random Stuff {#randomstuff}

- [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/) - If you want to spend hours on websites that serve no purpose whatsoever, this is the place for you. I like this website because it links to websites that are not trying to be anything, it has the spirit of the old internet where people would create a website because they could, not becuase they should. I don't know, it's hard to explain this one.

- [LINGsCARS](https://www.lingscars.com/) - This is a car rental company from the UK... The website is crazy, in an awesome way. I guess you can use it to rent a car if you go to the UK as well.

## Linkback
