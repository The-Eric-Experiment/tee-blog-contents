# Destinations {#destinations}

Places on the internet worth visiting. This is a list of my favorite websites.

The websites in this list are not necessarily compatible with old browsers.

- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) - From their website, the "Internet Archive is a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites and more."

  It's incredible how much they have been able to archive over the years, my favorite part is definitely the Wayback Machine, in which you can visit old websites.

- [The Old Net](http://theoldnet.com) - This is a project that aims to bring the internet of yesterday back. It uses the wayback machine apis to deliver the old websites while removing any code that would be incompatible with old browsers. With it you can browse the old internet on your retro computer. They also have a proxy server available that makes the experience way more immersive.

- [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/) - If you want to spend hours on websites that serve no purpose whatsoever, this is the place for you. I like this website because it links to websites that are not trying to be anything, it has the spirit of the old internet where people would create a website because they could, not becuase they should. I don't know, it's hard to explain this one.

- [LINGsCARS](https://www.lingscars.com/) - This is a car rental company from the UK... The website is crazy, in an awesome way. I guess you can use it to rent a car if you go to the UK as well.

- [Winworld](https://winworldpc.com/home) - This is a website that has been around since 2002 or 2003. This is THE website to find old versions of software in general, especially Microsoft operating sytems. It kinda sucks that they updated the website to use bootstrap or whatever, the old design used to be great.

- [Make Frontend Shit again](https://makefrontendshitagain.party/) - In the spirit of bringing personality back to the internet, Make frontend shit again!

- [Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net/) - I found this website in the old net webring, if you want to have an overdose of gifs and 90's design language, this website is for you. It's insane but I find it extremely nostalgic at the same time.

- [GifCities](https://gifcities.org/) - This is not like Giphy, instead, this uses the internet archive to find Gifs from geocities websites, so these are proper gifs from 90's websites.

- [Calmira.de](http://calmira.de) - Calmira is a replacement shell for Windows 3.x that makes it look and act like Windows 95. This website is also featured in the Windows 3.x resource page links, I'm putting it here because it's been around forever and it's still up.

- [VOGONS](https://www.vogons.org/) - This needs no introduction, it's the biggest forum about retro computing on the internet.
