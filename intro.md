<img src="/contents/public/avatar.jpg" align="left"> Hello! My name is Eric and this is my little corner of the Internet, a place where where you can check out many cool projects related to retro computing, retro gaming, coding, music, some other random tech stuff I'm working on as well as other things related to my life.

This website features a more diverse set of projects but I also run the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricMackrodt?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">The Eric Experiment</a> on YouTube, which is more focused on retro gaming and retro computing.

If you like those sorts of subjects, make sure to follow this website or subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricMackrodt?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>!

This website is Retro First, which means that it's built for Old Browsers, but it loads more features as you move to more modern browsers. It's not mobile friendly though because if you follow me, you probably browse the web on a computer.
