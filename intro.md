Hello! My name is Eric and I run The Eric Experiment, a place where you can check out many cool projects related to retro computing, retro gaming, coding, music, some other random tech stuff.

This website features a more diverse set of projects but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricMackrodt?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a> is more focused on retro gaming and retro computing.

If you like those sorts of subjects, make sure to follow this website or subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricMackrodt?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>!
