After having a [news article](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tiny-intel-486-runs-ms-dos) on Tom's Hardware about the Tiny 486 build, I was invited to participate on The Pi Cast from Tom's Hardware to talk about it.

It was a great privilege to be there and chat with them, I have link to the [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-Ly0TGcLGA) here, but you can check it out in other podcasting platforms!
