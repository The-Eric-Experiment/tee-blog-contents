Have you ever wondered if it's possible to use old PCI cards like the S3 Trio, Trident 9440, Sound Blaster Live and the 3dfx Voodoo 2 on a very modern computer like a Ryzen 9 3900X with 32gb of ram?

Well, in this part of the experiment I will try to answer that question.

Here are the articles and forum bosts mentioned in the video:
