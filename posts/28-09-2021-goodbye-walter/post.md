Goodbye my friend Walter. It really sucks that I couldn't have seen you in person and played with you in the last 6 years. But I still loved you because you were one of the best dogs ever.

I would have been able to play you a last time last year if it wasn't for this goddamn pandemic, but that's something we have no control over. So I'm just happy that you lived a happy life and died a happy pup next to my parents who took the best care of you.

I will never forget how you'd run when we unleashed you while going for a walk, so fast! We could see in your face that you were enjoying yourself so much.

I have lost many pets throughout the years. Manuela, my childhood dog at 14. Sheep the cat, at 14. Emily the little cat at 8 and many others. And now Walter at 11. You'd think it gets easier over time, but it doesn't. Those animals touch our lives and they are just as important as any human family member.

And Walter, like most pups, would be there for you, with no judgements, no complaints, just happy that you're around.

I'm so glad that I had you in my life, even if briefly, and that you had a good life. I really wish that you could've lived longer, but sadly that's not how life goes.

Goodbye again boy.

Love you.
