Today we'll do something a bit different from what we usually do on the Youtube channel. In this part of The Eric Experiment we'll do a Tier List of 90's internet gifs!

[Click here to open the Tier List](/contents/posts/11-01-2022-90s-gif-tier-list/tier-list/tier-list.html) if you want to give it a go and send me a screenshot on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ericmackrodt) when you're done.

### Where I got the gifs from:

- GifCities - [https://gifcities.org/](https://gifcities.org/)
- Cameron's World - [https://www.cameronsworld.net/](https://www.cameronsworld.net/)

### Here's the Oldavista guestbook:
