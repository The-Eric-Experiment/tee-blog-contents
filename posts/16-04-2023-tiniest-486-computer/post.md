In this video, join me as I finally reveal the tiniest 486 computer I have built from scratch, complete with a custom 3D printed mini case and monitor!

This project, over two years in the making, showcases the highlights of my journey, from its conception to the unique components that make it tick.

With its Intel 486DX4 100Mhz processor and genuine retro hardware, this little machine is a dream come true for space-conscious retro gaming and computing fans.

I'm particularly proud of this one, this is the most complex and intricate project I have ever worked on. If you told my 10-year-old self that one day I'd do this, he wouldn't have believed you!
