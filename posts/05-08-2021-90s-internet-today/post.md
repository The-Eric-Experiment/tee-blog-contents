Remember browsing the web in the 90's and early 2000's?

The era of Geocities, AOL, ICQ, IRC, tons of gifs, badly designed websites, dial-up connections, Netscape and a lot more of those lovely things?

Well, not only do I remember those times but I want to re-experience them.

So, in this part of The Eric Experiment we are going to travel back in time to relive that experience, so join me in this awesome adventure!
