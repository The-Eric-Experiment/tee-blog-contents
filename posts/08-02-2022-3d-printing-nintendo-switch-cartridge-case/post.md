description: In this VERY short experiment, I'll 3D print a case for my Switch cartridges because the ones I use are TOO small.

Yeah yeah, I know I said I hated Youtube shorts before, probably even more than I hate TikTok beacuse Youtube shouldn't try to emulate that platform, it should be what it's always been because it's really good at that, but alas!

This is a little experiment in having a short video about something that I've done that which wouldn't result in enough content for a full-length video.

I plan on making more of them, but I still haven't decided if I'll go the Youtube Short route or if I'll just post normal resolution/aspect-ratio short videos.

Let's see how it goes.

In the meanwhile make sure to check this thing out:
